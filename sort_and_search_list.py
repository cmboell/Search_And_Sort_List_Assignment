Assignment: Sort And Search List Assignment
Program: sort_and_search_list.py
Author: Colby Boell
Last date modified: 02/25/2022

The purpose of this program is to take a list and sort it in order and then allow user input to
search for a certain number (float number) in the list to see which index position it is in if it
is in the list at all
--FROM PREVIOUS ASSIGNMENT TO GET THE REVIEW ON THAT PART-- (EXTRA CREDIT)
The purpose of this program is to prompt the user for input that (if a number or a float) will be added
to a list and printed out. If the user inputs a string or letter it will not be added to the list. This is done
by using functions and try statements.
